                <h2>
                    I agree with the court's ruling
                </h2>

                    <li>
                        Police were previously allowed to conduct warrantless searchs for a few reasons:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Safety:</strong> finding hidden weapons that can be used to harm the officer
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Cell phones are generally not dangerous
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Preserve Evidence:</strong> prevent the arrestee from hiding or destroying
                                valuable evidence
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>"Faraday bags"</strong> can be used to block outside transmissions from
                                        reaching the cell phone
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        By blocking the phone from outside communication, the data on it can not be
                                        erased remotely
                                    </li>
                                    <img src="assets/img/info/faraday-bag.png" style="width:40%;">
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Searching a cell phone is much different from searching pockets or simple belongings
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The revolutionary <strong>digital age</strong> has drastically changed what able are
                                able to carry around nowadays
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A cell phone search is comparable to <strong>searching through a person's house</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Modern technology allows us to store all this in our pockets
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Just because all this can be stored in our pockets, it is of no less importance
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Warrants can be quickly obtained to search the devices
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The same technological innovations that now require officers to obtain warrants have
                                also made it faster and easier to acquire them
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Judges are available to sign search warrants "within 15 minutes"
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Court has carved out a <strong>possible exception</strong> to the warrant requirement
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Situations presenting sufficient evidence of "exigent circumstances" â€” for
                                        example, if a bomb is about to be set off, the warrant requirement may be waived
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But?
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Person A is carrying some illegal document in their wallet
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        As per the ruling, Person A is subject to search of their wallet and
                                        consequently the discovery of the document
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Person B is carrying the same document digitally, on their cell phone
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        However, Person B is free from the warrantless search of their cell phone?
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
