                    Explain how the court decision expanded or limited an individual’s constitutional rights
                </h3>
                <div class="container round-box">
                    <p>
                        The decision <strong>expanded an individual’s constitutional rights</strong> since they were now
                        safe from the warrantless search of their cell phones after arrest. The court unanimously held
                        that <strong>these searches were unconstitutional</strong> and found to be in violation of the
                        individual’s Fourth Amendment rights. The court declared that <strong>cell phones were
                            considered more than just a simple belonging</strong>, such as a pen, due to their “immense
                        storage capacity” and the “privacies of life” they contain.

                <h3>
                    Explain how the court decision expanded or limited the power of the state
                </h3>
                <div class="container round-box">
                    <p>
                        The decision <strong>limited the power of the state</strong> by restricting what law enforcement
                        could and could not analyze during a warrantless search. Due to the decision, police officers
                        performing an arrest are now <strong>required to request a warrant from a judge in order to scan
                            the contents of an individual’s cell phone</strong>. They are, however, <strong>allowed to
                            physically inspect it</strong>, in case it can be used as a weapon to harm an officer or to
                        check if it contains hidden items.
