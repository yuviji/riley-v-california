                        <u>August 22, 2009</u>: Riley is <strong>pulled over for driving on expired license registration
                            tags</strong>, driving a different car. Due to his license suspension, the <strong>car was
                            impounded</strong> and the officers <strong>performed a routine inventory search</strong> of
                        the vehicle. During this, they <strong>discovered two guns </strong> concealed in socks and
                        hidden under the engine hood. <strong>Riley was arrested for the possession of concealed and
                            loaded firearms.</strong>

                        Riley’s <strong>cell phone was taken</strong> from his pocket and <strong>analyzed by a gang
                            unit detective</strong>. They <strong>concluded Riley’s gang affiliation</strong> with the
                        Bloods after <strong>finding images</strong> of him performing gang signs along with other
                        <strong>indicia from his phone</strong>.

                        <strong>Ballistics tests tied Riley to the August 2 shooting</strong>, finally charging him with
                        shooting at an occupied vehicle, attempted murder, and assault with a semi-automatic firearm.
                        Riley tried suppressing the evidence discovered on his phone, <strong>claiming that it violated
                            his rights given by the Fourth Amendment, since no warrant had been issued prior to the
                            search of his cell phone</strong>.

                        Following gang experts’ testimony, Riley’s <strong>affiliation was cemented</strong> and the
                        motives behind the August 2 shooting were exposed. <strong>Riley was convicted of all
                            charges</strong> and sentenced fifteen years to life in prison, affirmed by the California
                        Court of Appeal, Fourth District, Division 1.
